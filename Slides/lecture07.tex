\small

\begin{itemize}
\item Definition: ``Participant observation is a research strategy whereby the researcher becomes involved in a social situation for the purpose of understanding the behaviour of those engaged in the setting\dots The outcome of the research is a detailed account of the activities and behaviour of those involved.''\footnote{p.265 from Burnham et al. 2008. \textit{Research Methods in Politics}. 2nd Edition. Palgrave.}
\end{itemize}
}


\frame{
\frametitle{{\large Participant Observation}}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em
\item<2-> Intentionally subjective/reflective; no belief in possible observational objectivity
\item<3-> Generally inductive in nature
\item<4-> Typically does not generate DSOs
\end{itemize}
}

% A common approach in case study research
% Breakdown of objectivity is this desirable or not?
