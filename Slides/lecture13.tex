\frametitle{Induction vs. Deduction?}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em
\item Induction and deduction are both integral to science

% example: the calculus of voting; modified theory based on new evidence

\item Theory testing and theory building both require observation
\end{itemize}

}

% the second calculus of voting (Riker and Ordeshook) was partly inductive

% theory development is separate from theory testing
% but the two are interrelated



% induction (bottom up) vs. deduction (top down; from theory to observation)
% generally, in political science, we are interested in building theories from earlier more acceptable theoretical premises
% if we believe the world operates in some way, we can draw more specific conjectures about features of the world
% and then test those conjectures using evidence

% yet, the result is that when we collect evidence, sometimes we falsify (or fail to find evidence in support of) our theories
% the results is that we must either amend our premises, amend our argument, or set scope conditions on theory

% these theories then become useful because by drawing generalities about the world, we are able to understand particular events
% when those particular events then deviate from expectations, it invites renewed theorizing, amendment of argument, or the implication of scope conditions

% so science is both deductive and inductive, though the way we talk about science is typically deductive


% in the end, however, our goal is to "explain" the world...that has to start from a mix of assumption-based theory, theory development expanding on previously validated theory, and novel data collection

\item Specific evidence
% don't use the evidence we will eventually test our theory on

	\end{itemize}

	\item Causal (``if-then'' logic)

% hypotheses are statements about observable implications
