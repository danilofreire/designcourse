\title{Causal Mechanisms and Process Tracing}

% Aside from knowing that one thing (X) caused another thing (Y), we often want to know how that causal process worked. This is the study of ``causal mechanisms''. How do we study causal mechanisms to gain a deeper understanding of causal relationships in politics? How do we study the process by which a causal effect plays out?

% do we care about mechanisms? how deep do we want to go into a mechanism?
% when are we satisfied that we have ``bottomed out'' a mechanism?

% if concepts have many parts and we theorize that it is one part of that concept that transmits a causal effect, should we ever study causality at the level of concepts or should we only study causality at the level of the constitutive attribute that is thought to be causally relevant?

% at its most basic level, it answers ``what happened?'' (i.e., it is descriptive history)
% the difference, however, is that it is about causal inference, which is implicitly about within-case counterfactuals
% generally, these are treated with a deterministic perspective on causality (if this hadn't happened, what would have happened instead?)

% application of logic and ``counterfactual'' method
% update beliefs about counterfactuals in sequence

% inductive versus deductive approach
% process tracing as a standalone method versus as a supplement to other methods
	% for example, often use very aggregated data to establish a relationship and process tracing to document how it comes about
