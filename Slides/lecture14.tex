\frametitle{Why do case studies?}

A case study can serve as any of the following:

\begin{itemize}\small
\item<2-> An in-depth investigation of a single case that stands alone
\item<3-> An in-depth investigation of a case that is compared with other case studies
\item<4-> An in-depth investigation of a case that precedes a ``large-N'' study of many cases
\item<5-> An in-depth investigation of a case that follows from a ``large-N'' study of many cases
\end{itemize}

}


% why do case studies?
%% variable identification
%% sequencing - what happened?
%% DSOs within case (different unit of analysis; or DSOs across time)
%% measurement - what is the score for this case on a variable?
%% search for confounders


% Wedeen - what is this? what is going on?
% Mershon - DSOs, lots of DSOs. what units of analysis?


% exploring a case as a DSO (already know what it is a case of)
% exploring a case to score a DSO (don't know what it's score is)
% exploring a case to decide what it is a case of (don't know the population or necessarily the variables)

\item<2-> The more important question is what is something a \textit{case of}
\item<2-> Cases are instances of a concept or phenomenon
	\begin{itemize}
	\item<3-> What is the Brexit referendum a case of?
	\item<4-> What is Islamic State a case of?
	\item<5-> What is Angela Merkel a case of?
	\item<6-> What is Sep. 11th a case of?
	\item<7-> What is Wales a case of?
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

}

% common cases: countries, subnational units, persons, political parties, events (e.g., acts of terrorism), revolutions, transitions to democracy, wars, policies, legislatures, elections


% an instance or observation can be a case of many different things
% September 11th might be a case of terrorism, of structural deficiencies in buildings, of airplane hijacking, of airport security, of intelligence failure, of presidential leadership, of the onset of war, of "rallying around the flag", etc.
% to study something as a case, you need to know what it is a case *of*
