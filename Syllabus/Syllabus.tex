\section{Introduction}
The course will introduce students to the fundamentals of research design in political science. The course will cover a range of topics, starting from the formulation of research topics and research questions, the development of theory and empirically testable hypotheses, the design of data collection activities, and basic qualitative and quantitative data analysis techniques. 

The course will address a variety of approaches to empirical political science research including experimental and quasi-experimental designs, large-n survey research, small-n case selection, and comparative/historical comparisons. As a result, topics covered in the course will be varied and span all areas of political science including political behaviour, institutions, comparative politics, international relations, and public administration.

Every week will involve the following in-person sessions:

	\begin{center}
	Lecture: \textbf{Friday 11:00--12:00 in 32L.B.09 (basement level)}\\
	Class: \textbf{Friday 13:00--14:00 in OLD.1.27}\\
	\hspace{2.8em} \textbf{Friday 15:00--16:00 in CLM 1.02}
	\end{center}

Class sessions are hosted by the Graduate Teaching Assistant.

\section{Learning Assessment and Feedback}

\subsection{Intended Learning Outcomes}

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

\begin{enumerate*}
\item Identify theories, hypotheses, and methods used in empirical political science research.
\item Apply different methods to political science research questions.
\item Analyze data to measure concepts, make comparisons, and draw inferences.
\item Define causation and the multiple ways of reaching causal inferences.
\item Communicate political science concepts, theories, and methods in writing.
\end{enumerate*}

These outcomes are indicative of what kinds of knowledge should be demonstrated on formative and summative assessments, including the exam.


\subsection{Assessment}

Students will be evaluated through (1) a 2-hour written exam covering the full breadth of course content and (2) a 3000-word written paper applying course material in the form of a research design proposal. The final mark will reflect an equal weighting of both forms of assessment.

The \textit{written exam} covers the full breadth of material from the course and will test students' knowledge of course content, including concept definition, the appraisal of political science theories, the generation of hypotheses, and --- most importantly --- the appropriateness of different research designs for answering specific research questions. Note the exam form is slightly different from that used in the 2015--16 academic year. A sample paper will be provided that conveys the structure used in 2016-17. The exam will count for 50\% of the final mark.

The \textit{research design proposal} should outline the basic elements of a novel research project, namely a research question, theoretical contribution, testable hypotheses, and a description of the proposed data collection and analysis. Unlike the written exam, this paper should focus narrowly on a topic of the student's choice and display a greater depth of understanding of a smaller set of ideas raised in the course. This will count for 50\% of the final mark. Students should work over the full academic year on the research design proposal. A schedule of formative deadlines for the proposal are:

\begin{itemize}
\item A proposal of two possible research topics is due at the end of November 2017 and will be presented in class.
\item A literature review of relevant existing research is due at the end of February 2018.
\item The final essay is due on Tuesday, 20 March 2018 at 5:00pm.
\end{itemize}

As formative work in preparation for both exam forms, students will complete short ``problem set'' assignments, approximately every other week (see course schedule for details), which allow them to apply material from the course to concrete political science examples (e.g., identifying design elements of a published research paper; proposing strategies for answering a given research question, etc.). While these formative assessments do not count toward the final mark, they provide an opportunity for peer and instructor feedback.

\subsection{Assignments}

The topic of each assignment (problem set or otherwise) and the due date for each are as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll} \toprule
\textbf{Assignment} & \textbf{Type} & \textbf{Due Date} \\ \midrule
Identifying and Evaluating Claims & Problem Set 1 & Tuesday Oct.~17 \\
Concepts and Measurement & Problem Set 2 & Tuesday Nov.~7 \\
Data Collection I & Problem Set 3 & Tuesday Nov.~21 \\
Data Collection II & Problem Set 4 & Tuesday Dec.~5 \\
Proposal Topics Presentation & Formative Presentation & Nov./Dec. \\  \midrule 
Causality & Problem Set 5 & Tuesday Jan.~16 \\
Theory Evaluation & Problem Set 6 & Tuesday Feb.~13 \\
Article Critique & Problem Set 7 & Tuesday Feb.~27 \\
Literature Review & Formative Essay & Reading Week \\ 
Statistics and Regression & Problem Set 8 & Tuesday Mar.~13 \\ \midrule 
Final Research Design Proposal & Summative Essay & Tuesday Mar.~20 \\ \midrule 
ST Exam & Summative Exam & ST TBA \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

All assignments are due on Tuesday, via Moodle unless otherwise stated. Written and/or oral feedback will be provided by the next lecture after the end of that week. So, if an assignment is due Tuesday October 11, feedback will be provided by Friday October 21.

\subsection{Assignment Policies}

All work for the course should follow policies and procedures as described in the Government Department's Undergraduate Student Handbook\footnote{http://www.lse.ac.uk/government/StudentInformation/Current-undergraduate-students/Undergraduate-Handbook.aspx}. Students should, in particular, be aware of the LSE policy on plagiarism (\url{http://www.lse.ac.uk/socialPolicy/InformationForCurrentStudents/plagiarism.aspx}).

No late work will be accepted and given the long-term nature of the research design proposal, it is the general policy of the course not to offer extensions on this.

\subsection{Special Note for General Course Students}

Students in the General Course must complete all formative and summative coursework. In addition to the overall final mark for the course, General Course students will also receive a ``class grade'' as determined by the instructor and GTA. 

This mark will be determined by the following formula:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rl}
10\% & Class Attendance \\
10\% & Lecture and Online Participation \\
20\% & Class Participation \\
20\% & Group and Individual Projects \\
40\% & Performance on Formative Problem Sets (8 x 5\% each) \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

For more details on this, please see the LSE website.\footnote{\url{http://www.lse.ac.uk/study/generalCourse/currentStudentsAndAlumni/GeneralCourseAssessment.aspx}}
