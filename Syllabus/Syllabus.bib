  abstract     = {Statistical modeling is a powerful tool for developing and testing theories by way of causal explanation, prediction, and description. In many disciplines there is near-exclusive use of statistical modeling for causal explanation and the assumption that models with high explanatory power areinherently of high predictive power. Conflation between explanation and prediction is common, yet the distinction must be understood for progressingscientific knowledge. While this distinction has been recognized in the philosophy of science, the statistical literature lacks a thorough discussion of themany differences that arise in the process of modeling for an explanatory versus a predictive goal. The purpose of this article is to clarify the distinction between explanatory and predictive modeling, to discuss its sources, and to reveal the practical implications of the distinction to each step in the modeling process.},

We argue that the extra work required in producing graphs is rewarded by greatly enhanced presentation and communication of empirical results.We illustrate their benefits by turning several published tables into graphs, including tables that present descriptive data and regression results.We show that regression graphs emphasize point estimates and confidence intervals and that they can successfully present the results of regression models. A move away from tables towards graphs would improve the discipline's communicative output and make empirical findings more accessible to every type of audience.},

Causal effects estimated via multiple regression differentially weight each unit's contribution. The `effective sample' that regression uses to generate the estimate may bear little resemblance to the population of interest, and the resultsmay be nonrepresentative in a manner similar to what quasi-experimental methods or experiments with convenience samples produce. There is no general external validity basis for preferring multiple regression on representative samples over quasi-experimental or experimental methods. We show how to estimate the `multiple regression weights' that allow one to study the effective sample. We discuss alternative approaches that, under certain conditions, recover representative average causal effects. The requisite conditions cannot always be met.},

What Is a Case Study and What Is It Good for?

JOHN GERRING Boston University


This paper aims to clarify the meaning, and explain the utility, of the case study method, a methodoften practiced but little understood. A ``case study,'' I argue, is best defined as an intensive studyof a single unit with an aim to generalize across a larger set of units. Case studies rely on the

same sort of covariational evidence utilized in non-case study research. Thus, the case study method is

correctly understood as a particular way of defining cases, not a way of analyzing cases or a way of

modeling causal relations. I show that this understanding of the subject illuminates some of the persistent

ambiguities of case studywork, ambiguities that are, to some extent, intrinsic to the enterprise. The travails

of the case study within the discipline of political science are also rooted in an insufficient appreciation of

themethodological tradeoffs that thismethod calls forth. This paper presents the familiar contrast between

case study and non-case study work as a series of characteristic strengths and weaknesses-affinities-

rather than as antagonistic approaches to the empirical world. In the end, the perceived hostility between

case study and non-case study research is largely unjustified and, perhaps, deserves to be regarded as a

misconception. Indeed, the strongest conclusion to arise from this methodological examination concerns

the complementarity of single-unit and cross-unit research designs.

To meet this assumption, researchers often rely on a strategy of selecting covariates that they think will control for selection bias. Theory indicates that the most important covariates are those highly correlated with both the real selection process and the potential outcomes. However, when planning a study, it is rarely possible to identify such covariates with certainty. In this article, we report on an extensive reanalysis of a within-study comparison that contrasts a randomized experiment and a quasi-experiment. Various covariate sets were used to adjust for initial group differences in the quasi-experiment that was characterized by self-selection into treatment. The adjusted effect sizes were then compared with the experimental ones to identify which individual covariates, and which conceptually grouped sets of covariates, were responsible for the high degree of bias reduction achieved in the adjusted quasi-experiment. Such results provide strong clues about preferred strategies for identifying the covariates most likely to reduce bias when planning a study and when the true selection process is not known.},

  abstract  = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

  abstract  = {An increasing number of studies in political communication focus on the ``sentiment'' or ``tone'' of news content, political speeches, or advertisements. This growing interest in measuring sentiment coincide with a dramatic increase in the volume of digitized information. Computer automation has a great deal of potential in this new media environment. The objective here is to outline and validate a new automated measurement instrument for sentiment analysis in political texts. Our instrument uses a dictionary-based approach consisting of a simple word count of the frequency of keywords in a text from a predefined dictionary. The design of the freely available Lexicoder Sentiment Dictionary (LSD) is discussed in detail here. The dictionary is tested against a body of human-coded news content, and the resulting codes are also compared to results from nine existing content-analytic dictionaries. Analyses suggest that the LSD produces results that are more systematically related to human coding than are results based on the other available dictionaries. The LSD is thus a useful starting point for a revived discussion about dictionary construction and validation in sentiment analysis for political communication.},

  abstract  = {Over the past several years, there has been growing use of the draft lottery instrument to study political attitudes and behaviors (see, e.g., Bergan 2009; Erikson and Stoker 2011; Henderson 2012; Davenport 2015). Draft lotteries, held in the United States from 1969 to 1972, provide a potentially powerful design; in theory, they should provide true randomization for the `treatment' of military service or behavioral reactions to the threat of such service. However, the first draft lottery conducted in 1969 was not conducted in a random manner, giving those citizens born in the fourth quarter of the year disproportionately higher chances of being drafted. In this note, we describe the randomization failure and discuss how this failure could in theory compromise the use of draft lottery numbers as an instrumental variable. We then use American National Election Studies data to provide support for the conclusion that individuals most affected by the randomization failure (those born in the fourth quarter of the year) largely do not look statistically distinct from those born at other times of the year. With some caveats, researchers should be able to treat the 1969 draft numbers as if they were assigned at random. We also discuss broader lessons to draw from this example, both for scholars interested in using the draft lottery as an instrumental variable, and for researchers leveraging other instruments with randomization failures. Specifically, we suggest that scholars should pay particular attention to the sources of randomization failure, sample attrition, treatment and dependent variable selection, and possible failure of the exclusion restriction, and we outline ways in which these problems may apply to the draft lottery instrument and other natural experiments.},

  abstract     = {Gornments in Italy both change and remain the same. From 1946 to 1992 the Christian Democratic Party always held governing power. But almost no cabinet stayed in office more than a few years, and many governments collapsed after only a few months. How can instability coexist with stability in this way? How can governments break up at such low cost and with so little effect on alternation? These questions are rooted in- but not resolved by-the available game-theoretic literature on coalitional behavior. My answer is that politicians'purposive actions can reduce the costs of coalition. I argue that the costs of making, breaking, and maintaining coalitions depend on political institutions and on the array of parties and voters in policy space. Institutional and spatial conditions structure politicians' opportunities and attempts to lower costs. Under some conditions, as I show, coalitions are cheap, and politicians can easily make coalitions even cheaper. The inference is that this framework comprehends both Italy's extremes and the degrees of stability found in other parliamentary democracies.},

  abstract  = {Cohen (1962) pointed out the importance of statistical power for psychology as a science, but statistical power of studies has not increased, while the number of studies in a single article has increased. It has been overlooked that multiple studies with modest power have a high probability of producing nonsignificant results because power decreases as a function of the number of statistical tests that are being conducted (Maxwell, 2004). The discrepancy between the expected number of significant results and the actual number of significant results in multiple-study articles undermines the credibility of the reported results, and it is likely that questionable research practices have contributed to the reporting of too many significant results (Sterling, 1959). The problem of low power in multiple-study articles is illustrated using Bem's (2011) article on extrasensory perception and Gailliot et al.'s (2007) article on glucose and self-regulation. I conclude with several recommendations that can increase the credibility of scientific evidence in psychological journals. One major recommendation is to pay more attention to the power of studies to produce positive results without the help of questionable research practices and to request that authors justify sample sizes with a priori predictions of effect sizes. It is also important to publish replication studies with nonsignificant results if these studies have high power to replicate a published finding.

we know little about how daily life within these neighborhoods is affected. Almost all
ethnographic work in poor minority neighborhoods was written before the expansion of
the criminal justice system, and the bulk of research on “mass imprisonment” relies on
survey data, field experiments, or interviews, conceptualizing its impact in terms of
current or former felons and their families. Drawing on six years of fieldwork in
Philadelphia, this article shifts the focus from imprisonment and criminal records to the
increase in policing and supervision in poor Black neighborhoods, and what this has
meant for a growing status group of wanted people. For many young men, avoiding jail
has become a daily preoccupation: they have warrants out for minor infractions, like
failing to pay court fees or breaking curfew, and will be detained if they are identified.
Such threat of imprisonment transforms social relations by undermining already tenuous
attachments to family, work, and community. But young men also rely on their precarious
legal standing to explain failures that would have occurred anyway, while girlfriends and
neighbors exploit their wanted status as an instrument of social control. I discuss the
implications of my ethnographic observations relative to prior treatments of the poor and
policing, and with regard to broader sociological questions about punishment and
surveillance in the modern era.},

Nuclear Non-Use

We have recently witnessed the fiftieth anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima and

Nagasaki, the only use of nuclear weapons in warfare. The non-use of nuclear weap-

ons since then remains the single most important phenomenon of the nuclear age. Yet

we still lack a full understanding of how this tradition arose and is maintained and of

its prospects for the future. The widely cited explanation is deterrence, but this ac-

count is either wrong or incomplete. Although an element of sheer luck no doubt has

played a part in this fortuitous outcome, this article argues that a normative element

must be taken into account in explaining why nuclear weapons have not been used

since 1945. A normative prohibition on nuclear use has developed in the global

system, which, although not (yet) a fully robust norm, has stigmatized nuclear weap-

ons as unacceptable weapons of mass destruction. Without this normative stigma,

there might have been more ``use.''1 This article examines this phenomenon in the

context of the nuclear experience of the United States.


This investigation is motivated by several empirical anomalies in the conventional

account-deterrence-of the non-use of nuclear weapons since 1945. First is the

non-use of nuclear weapons in cases where there was no fear of nuclear retaliation,

that is, where the adversary could not retaliate in kind. This anomaly includes the first

ten years or so of the nuclear era, when the United States possessed first an absolute

nuclear monopoly and then an overwhelming nuclear advantage over the Soviet Union.

It also includes non-use by the United States in Vietnam (where the United States

dropped tonnage equivalent to dozens of Hiroshima bombs) and in the 1991 Persian

1. By ``use'' I mean dropping or launching nuclear weapons in all circumstances other than testing.

States have obviously relied on nuclear weapons in other ways, including for deterrence, making threats,

and alliance relations.

  abstract  = {A grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic. Such a grammar allows us to move beyond named graphics (e.g., the ``scat-
terplot'') and gain insight into the deep structure that underlies statistical graphics. This article builds on Wilkinson, Anand, and Grossman (2005), describing extensions and refinements developed while building an open source implementation of the grammar of graphics for R, ggplot2.

The topics in this article include an introduction to the grammar by working through the process of creating a plot, and discussing the components that we need. The grammar is then presented formally and compared to Wilkinson's grammar, highlighting the hierarchy of defaults, and the implications of embedding a graphical grammar into a programming language. The power of the grammar is illustrated with a selection of examples that explore different components and their interactions, in more detail. The article concludes by discussing some perceptual issues, and thinking about how we can build on the grammar to learn how to create graphical ``poems.''},

This article introduces and assesses a new political explanation for the origins of "developmental states"-organizational complexes in which expert and coherent bureaucratic agencies collaborate with organized private sectors to spur national economic transformation. Conventional wisdom holds that developmental states in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore result from "state autonomy," especially from popular pressures. We argue that these states' impressive capacities actually emerged from the challenges of delivering side payments to restive popular sectors under conditions of extreme geopolitical insecurity and severe resource constraints. Such an interactive condition of "systemic vulnerability" never confronted ruling elites in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, or Thailand-allowing them to uphold political coalitions, and hence to retain power, with much less ambitious state-building efforts.},
