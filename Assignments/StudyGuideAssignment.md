# Exam Study Guide Assignment

## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to assess your overall learning for the course and your preparedness for the exam.

## Overview

You are being asked to develop a "study guide" for GV249, which you will use to prepare for the exam. This activity is meant to be reflective and to aid you with a self-assessment of your own learning so far in the course, so that you can identify areas to address in preparation for the exam.

## Your Task

 1. Develop a "study guide" for GV249. This should include key terms and concepts, theoretical ideas, readings, research methods, etc. that are likely to be covered on the exam. The outline should not include details and definitions, but rather be an outline of what knowledge is needed to succeed on the exam. The guide can be structured in whatever form you consider useful and appropriate.
 
 2. You will submit your study guide for peer assessment via Moodle during Lent Term Reading Week. As part of peer assessment, you will be asked to evaluate your peers' study guides for completeness and clarity. This exercise will help you to see what you may or may not yet understand about the course, as well as assist your peers with the same reflection.
 
 3. Finally, after conducting a peer assessment, you will self-assess your own study guide and reflect on your own preparation for the exam in light of the topics covered in readings and lecture and in light of the learning outcomes for the course.

## Submission Instructions

Your assignment can be in any length or format, but should be uploaded to Moodle no later than Thursday February 18. The document you upload should be anonymous (i.e., not list your name or other identifying information).

You must then read and assess two study guides uploaded by peers from the course, provide feedback to those peers according to a rubric, and then self-assess your own study guide by March 1.

## Feedback

Peer feedback will be given during Lent Term reading week. You will not receive a mark on your study guide, but you will receive instructor feedback on the quality of your assessments and reflections.
